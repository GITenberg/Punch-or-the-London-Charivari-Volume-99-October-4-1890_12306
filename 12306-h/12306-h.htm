    <h2>MR. PUNCH'S PRIZE NOVELS.</h2>

    <h4>NEW SERIES.&mdash;IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.</h4>

    <p>This age has been called an Age of Progress, an Age of
    Reform, an Age of Intellect, an Age of Shams; everything in
    fact except an Age of Prizes. And yet, it is perhaps as an Age
    of Prizes that it is destined to be chiefly remembered. The
    humble but frantic solver of Acrostics has had his turn, the
    correct expounder of the law of Hard Cases has by this time
    established a complete code of etiquette; the doll-dresser, the
    epigram-maker, the teller of witty stories, the calculator who
    can discover by an instinct the number of letters in a given
    page of print, all have displayed their ingenuity, and have
    been magnificently rewarded by prizes varying in value from the
    mere publication of their names, up to a policy of life
    insurance, or a completely furnished mansion in Peckham Rye. In
    fact, it has been calculated by competent actuaries that taking
    a generation at about thirty-three years, and making every
    reasonable allowance for errors of postage, stoppage <i>in
    transitu</i>, fraudulent bankruptcies and unauthorised
    conversions, 120 per cent. of all persons alive in Great
    Britain and Ireland in any given day of twenty-four hours, must
    have received a prize of some sort.</p>

    <p>Novelists, however, have not as yet received a prize of any
    sort, at least as novelists. The reproach is about to be
    removed. A prize of &pound;1000 has been offered for the best
    novel by the Editor of a newspaper. The most distinguished
    writers are, so it is declared, entered for the Competition,
    but only the name of the prize-winner is to be revealed, only
    the prize-winning novel is to be published. Such at least has
    been the assurance given to all the eminent authors by the
    Editor in question. But <i>Mr. Punch</i> laughs at other
    people's assurances, and by means of powers conferred upon him
    by himself for that purpose, he has been able to obtain access
    to all the novels hitherto sent in, and will now publish a
    selection of Prize Novels, together with the names of their
    authors, and a few notes of his own, wherever the text may seem
    to require them.</p>

    <p>In acting thus <i>Mr. Punch</i> feels, in the true spirit of
    the newest and the Reviewest of Reviews, that he is conferring
    a favour on the authors concerned by allowing them the
    publicity of these columns. Sometimes pruning and condensation
    may be necessary. The operation will be performed as kindly as
    circumstances permit. It is hardly necessary to add that <i>Mr.
    Punch</i> will <i>give his own prize in his own way, and at his
    own time</i>, to the author he may deem the best. And herewith
    <i>Mr. Punch</i> gives a specimen of&mdash;</p>

        <p>[PREFATORY NOTE.&mdash;This Novel was carefully wrapped
        up in some odd leaves of MARK TWAIN'S <i>Innocents
        Abroad</i>, and was accompanied by a letter in which the
        author declared that the book was worth &pound;3000, but
        that "to save any more blooming trouble," he would be
        willing to take the prize of &pound;1000 by return of post,
        and say no more about it.&mdash;ED.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

    <p>It was all the Slavey what got us into the mess. Have you
    ever noticed what a way a Slavey has of snuffling and saying,
    "Lor, Sir, oo'd 'a thought it?" on the slightest provocation.
    She comes into your room just as you are about to fill your
    finest two-handed meerschaum with Navy-cut, and looks at you
    with a far-away look in her eyes, and a wisp of hair winding
    carelessly round the neck of her print dress. You murmur
    something in an insinuating way about that box of Vestas you
    bought last night from the blind man who stands outside "The
    Old King of Prussia" pub round the corner. Then one of her
    hairpins drops into the fireplace, and you rush to pick it up,
    and she rushes at the same moment, and your head goes crack
    against her head, and you see some stars, and a weary kind of
    sensation comes over you, and just as you feel inclined to send
    for the cat's-meat man down the next court to come and fetch
    you away to the Dogs' Home, in bounces your landlady, and with
    two or three "Well, I nevers!" and "There's an imperent 'ussey,
    for you!" nearly bursts the patent non-combustible bootlace you
    lent her last night to hang the brass locket round her neck
    by.</p>

    <p>POTTLE says his landlady's different, but then POTTLE always
    was a rum 'un, and nobody knows what old rag-and-bone shop he
    gets his landladies from. I always get mine only at the best
    places, and advise everybody else to do the same. I mentioned
    this once to BILL MOSER, who looks after the calico department
    in the big store in the High Street, but he only sniffed, and
    said, "Garne, you don't know everythink!" which was rude of
    him. I might have given him one for himself just then, but I
    didn't. I always was a lamb; but I made up my mind that next
    time I go into the ham-and-beef shop kept by old Mother MOSER
    I'll say something about "'orses from Belgium" that the old
    lady won't like.</p>

    <p>Did you ever go into a ham-and-beef shop? It's just like
    this. I went into MOSER'S last week. Just when I got in I
    tripped over some ribs of beef lying in the doorway, and before
    I had time to say I preferred my beef without any
    boot-blacking, I fell head-first against an immense sirloin on
    the parlour table. Mrs. MOSER called all the men who were
    loafing around, and all the boys and girls, and they carved
    away at the sirloin for five hours without being able to get my
    head out. At last an old gentleman, who was having his dinner
    there, said he couldn't bear whiskers served up as a vegetable
    with his beef. Then they knew they'd got near my face, so they
    sent away the Coroner and pulled me out, and when I got home my
    coat-tail pockets were full of old ham-bones. The boy did
    that&mdash;young varmint! I'll ham-bone him when I catch him
    next!</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

    <p>Let me see, what was I after? Oh, yes, I remember. I was
    going to tell you about our Slavey and the pretty pickle she
    got us into. I'm not sure it wasn't POTTLE'S fault. I said to
    him, just as he was wiping his mouth on the back of his hand
    after his fourth pint of shandy-gaff, "POTTLE, my boy," I said,
    "you're no end of a chap for shouting 'Cash forward!' so that
    all the girls in the shop hear you and say to one another, 'My,
    what a lovely voice that young POTTLE'S got!' But you're not
    much good at helping a pal to order a new coat, nor for the
    matter of that, in helping him to try it on." But POTTLE only
    hooked up his nose and looked scornful. Well, when the coat
    came home the Slavey brought it up, and put it on my best
    three-legged chair, and then flung out of the room with a toss
    of her head, as much as to say, "'Ere's extravagance!" First I
    looked at the coat, and then the coat seemed to look at me.
    Then I lifted it up and put it down again, and sent out for
    three-ha'porth of gin. Then I tackled the blooming thing again.
    One arm went in with a ten-horse power shove. Next I tried the
    other. After no end of fumbling I found the sleeve. "In you
    go!" I said to my arm, and in he went, only it happened to be
    the breast-pocket. I jammed, the pocket creaked, but I jammed
    hardest, and in went my fist, and out went the pocket.</p>

    <p>Then I sat down, tired and sad, and the lodging-house cat
    came in and lapped up the milk for my tea, and MOSER'S bull-dog
    just looked me up, and went off with the left leg of my
    trousers, and the landlady's little boy peeped round the door
    and cried, "Oh, Mar, the poor gentleman's red in the
    face&mdash;I'm sure he's on fire!" And the local fire-brigade
    was called up, and they pumped on me for ten minutes, and then
    wrote "Inextinguishable" in their note-books, and went home;
    and all the time I couldn't move, because my arms were stuck
    tight in a coat two sizes too small for me.</p>

        A spectator who has taken part in modern regular war, and
        has watched the manoeuvres, said one day to me when I
        accosted him, in an apologetic tone, 'I have hitherto done
        your Army injustice, I will not do so again; I had no idea
        how well your officers and your troopers ride,&mdash;they
        are very fine horsemen.' There he stopped; I waited for
        more, but he had ended; his silence was a crushing
        criticism, unintentionally too severe, but very true.... I
        assert, therefore, that at this moment, our Cavalry is
        inefficient, and not prepared for war."&mdash;<i>The Times

    increased. At all hours of the day and night they were called
    up to receive persons who desired an interview with their chief
    and master. As they had received strict orders from His
    Highness never to appear in anything but full uniform (cloth of
    gold tunics, silver-tissue trousers, and belts and epaulettes
    of diamonds) they spent most of their time in changing their
    costume.</p>

    <p>"I am here to see anyone and everyone," said His Highness;
    "but I look to you, Gentlemen of the Ring, I should say
    Household, to see that I am disturbed by only those who have
    the right of <i>entr&eacute;e</i>. And now,
    <i>houp-l&agrave;!</i> You can go."</p>

    <p>Thus dismissed, the unfortunate <i>aides-de-camp</i> could
    but bow, and retire in silence. But, though they gave no
    utterance to their thoughts, their reflections were of a
    painful character. They felt what with five reviews a day, to
    say nothing of what might be termed scenes in the circle
    (attendances at the Bois, dances at the H&ocirc;tel de Ville,
    and the like), their entire exhaustion was only a question of
    weeks, or even days.</p>

    <p>One morning the General-President, weary of interviews, was
    about to retire into his <i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i>, there to
    discuss the twenty-five courses of his simple
    <i>d&eacute;jeuner &agrave; la fourchette</i>, when he was
    stopped by a person in a garb more remarkable for its
    eccentricity than its richness. This person wore a coat with
    tails a yard long, enormous boots, a battered hat, and a red
    wig. A close observer would have doubted whether his nose was
    real or artificial. The strangely-garbed intruder bowed
    grotesquely.</p>

    <p>"What do you want with me?" asked the General-President,
    sharply. "Do you not know I am busy?"</p>

    <p>"Not too busy to see me," retorted the unwelcome guest,
    striking up a lively tune upon a banjo which he had concealed
    about his person while passing the Palace Guard, but which he
    now produced. "I pray you step with me a measure."</p>

    <p>Thus courteously invited, His Highness could but comply, and
    for some ten minutes host and guest indulged in a
    breakdown.</p>

    <p>"And now, what do you want with me?" asked the
    General-President when the dance had been brought to a
    satisfactory conclusion.</p>

    <p>"My reward," was the prompt reply.</p>

    <p>"Reward!" echoed His Highness. "Why, my good friend, I have
    refused a Royal Duke, an Imperial Prince, a Powerful Order, and
    any number of individuals, who have made a like demand."</p>

    <p>"Ah! but they did not do so much for you as I did."</p>

    <p>"Well, I don't know," returned the General-President, "but
    they parted with their gold pretty freely."</p>

    <p>"Gold!" retorted the visitor, contemptuously, "I gave you
    more than gold. From me you had notes. Where would you have
    been without my songs?" He took off his false nose, and thus
    enabled the General-President to recognise the "Pride of the
    Music Halls!"</p>

    <p>"You will find I am not ungrateful," said the Chief of the
    State, with difficulty suppressing his emotion.</p>

    <p>His Highness was as good as his word. The next night at the
    <i>Caf&eacute; des Ambassadeurs</i> there was a novel
    attraction. An old favourite was described in the
    <i>affiches</i> as <i>le Due de Nouveau-Cirque</i>.</p>

    <p>The reception that old favourite received in the course of
    the evening was fairly, but not too cordial. But enthusiasm and
    hilarity reached fever-heat when, on turning his face from
    them, the audience discovered that their droll was wearing (in
    a somewhat grotesque fashion) the <i>grand cordon</i> of the
    Legion of Honour on his back! Then it was felt that France
    <i>must</i> be safe in the hands of a man whose sense of the
    fitness of things rivalled the taste of the pig whose soul
    soared above the charm of pearls!</p>

    <h2>SCOTT-FREE; OR, RAVENSWOOD-NOTES WILD.</h2>

    <p>ACT I.&mdash;A grand old Castle in the distance, with
    foreground of rude and rugged rocks. Around the rugged rocks a
    quaint funeral service. HENRY IRVING, "the Master" not only of
    <i>Ravenswood</i>, but the art of acting (as instanced by a
    score of fine impersonations), flouts the veteran comedian,
    HOWE; and, Howe attired? He is in some strange garb as a
    nondescript parson. Then "Master" (as the <i>Sporting Times</i>
    would irreverently speak of him) soliloquises over Master's
    father's coffin. Arrival of <i>Sir William Ashton</i>. Row and
    flashing of steel in torchlight. Appearance of one lovely
    beyond compare&mdash;ELLEN TERRY, otherwise <i>Lucy Ashton</i>;
    graceful as a Swan. Swan and Edgar. Curtain.</p>

        <h3>MR. IRVING MAKING HIS GREAT HIT. THE
        BULL'S-EYE!</h3>After such a hit,&mdash;"there is no cause
        for fear now!"
    </div>

    <p>ACT II.&mdash;Library and Armoury. Convenient swords and
    loaded blunderbusses. <i>Lord Keeper Ashton</i> appears. Quite
    right that there should be the Keeper present, in view of
    <i>Lucy</i> subsequently going mad. Young <i>Henry Ashton</i>,
    the youth GORDON CRAIG, a lad of promise, and performance, has
    the entire stage to himself for full two minutes, to show what
    he can do with a speech descriptive of some pictures. Master
    alone with Keeper, suggests duel. Why arms in Library, unless
    duel? Fight about to commence according to Queensberry rules,
    when Master sees portrait. Whose? <i>Lucy's</i>? "No," says
    Master; "not to be taken in. I know LUCY'S picture; it was done
    by WARD." The Keeper explains that this is a portrait, not of
    the author of <i>The History of Two Parliaments</i>, and
    <i>Fleecing Gideon</i>, but of his daughter <i>Lucy</i>, which
    has never yet been seen in any exhibition or loan collection.
    "Oho," says Master, "then I won't fight a chap who has a
    daughter like that." Ha! Mad bull "heard without"&mdash;one of
    the "herd without,"&mdash;Master picks up blunderbuss, no
    blunder, makes a hit and saves a miss; <i>i.e.</i>,
    <i>Lucy</i>. What shall he have who kills the bull with a bull
    'it? Why, a tent at Cowshot, near Bisley.</p>

    orchestra, and on stage&mdash;storm&mdash;Miss MARRIOTT
    admirable as old Witch&mdash;red light in

    <p>ACT III.&mdash;A Scene never to be forgotten&mdash;the
    Mermaiden's Well (quite well, thank you), by HAWES CRAVEN,
    henceforth to be HAWES McCRAVENSWOOD. Pines, heather, sunlight,
    and two picturesque lovers, Master and Miss, exchanging vows.
    Master gloomy, Miss lively. Miss promises to become Missus.
    Enter Master's future Modern Mother-in-law. Intended to be
    vindictive, but really a comfortable and comely body. Might be
    <i>Mrs. McBouncer</i> in <i>McBox and McCox</i>. Naturally
    enough, off goes Master to France.</p>

    <p>ACT IV.&mdash;Another splendid scene. Magnificently attired,
    <i>Hayston of Bucklaw</i> attempts to raise a laugh. Success.
    <i>Mrs. Mac Bouncer</i> coerces <i>Lucy</i> in white satin to
    sign the fatal contract that will settle Master. Ah! that awful
    laugh&mdash;far more tragic than the one secured by
    <i>Bucklaw</i>! It is <i>Lucy</i> going mad! She has already
    shown signs of incipient insanity by calling Mr. HOWE,
    otherwise <i>Bide-the-Bent</i>, a "holy Father,"&mdash;much to
    that excellent comedian's surprised content. Contract signed.
    Return of "Master." <i>D&eacute;no&ucirc;ment</i> must be seen
    to be appreciated. Here McMERIVALE bids Sir WALTER good-bye,
    and finishes in his own way. Last scene of all, and the
    loveliest. The earliest rays of the sun shining on the
    advancing tide! <i>Caleb</i> picks up all that is left of
    "Master"&mdash;a feather! With Miss ELLEN, Master HENRY,
    McMARRIOTT, McMERIVALE, MACKINTOSH, MACKENZIE, and HAWES
    McCRAVENSWOOD, here is a success which the advancing tide of
    popular favour will float till Easter or longer, and will then
    leave a new feather in the cap of Master.</p>

    <p>"HATS OFF!"&mdash;MR. EDWARD CROSSLEY, M.P., is to be
    congratulated on a narrow escape, according to the report in
    the <i>Times</i> last week. During service in the Free Church
    at Brodick, some portion of the ceiling gave way, Mr. CROSSLEY
    was covered with plaster&mdash;better to be covered with
    plaster before than after an accident&mdash;and "<i>his hat was
    cut to pieces</i>." From which it is to be inferred that "hats
    are much worn" during Divine service in the Free Church, as in
    the Synagogue. And so no fanatic can be admitted who has "a
    tile off." How fortunate for Mr. E. CROSSLEY that this ancient
    custom of the Hebrews is still observed in the Free Kirk. Since
    then Mr. CROSSLEY has bought a new tile, and is, therefore,
    perfectly re-covered.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The Baron says that he has scarcely been able to get through
    the first morning of <i>The Last Days of Palmyra</i>, which
    story, so far, reminds him&mdash;it being the fashion just now
    to mention Cardinal NEWMAN's works&mdash;of the latter's
    <i>Callista</i>. And <i>&agrave; propos</i> of <i>Callista</i>
    let me refer my readers to one of the best written articles on
    the Cardinal that I have seen. It is to be found in <i>Good
    Words</i> for October, and is by Mr. R.H. HUTTON. The Baron is
    coaching himself up for a visit to the Lyceum to see
    <i>Ravenswood</i>, of which, on all hands, he hears so much
    that is good. What a delightful scene where <i>Caleb</i> steals
    the wild-fowl from the spit, and the subsequent one, where
    <i>Dame Lightbody</i> cuffs the astonished little bairn's head!
    "As fresh to me," protests the Baron, "laughing in my chair, as
    I have been doing but a minute ago, as it was when I read it,
    the Council and Kirk-session only know how long ago!" And this
    farcical scene was considered so "grotesquely and absurdly
    extravagant" by Sir WALTER's contemporary critics (peace be to
    their hashes! Who <i>were</i> they? What were their names? Who
    cares?) that the great novelist actually explains how the
    incident was founded on one in real life.</p>

    <p>Now to my books. Gadzooks, what's here? Another volume of
    <i>Obiter Dicta?</i> By one author this time, for if my memory
    fails me not, the previous little book was writ by two scribes.
    Well, no matter&mdash;or rather lots of matter&mdash;and by
    AUGUSTINE BIRRELL, who represents <i>Obiter</i> and
    <i>Dicta</i> too. With an unclassical false quantity anyone who
    so chooses to unscholarise himself, can speak of him as the
    <i>O'Biter</i>, so sharp and pungent are some of his remarks.
    Ah! here is something on LAMB. For me, quoth the Baron, LAMB is
    always in season, serve up the dish with what trimmings you
    may, but, if you please, no sauce. Size and shape are the only
    things against friend <i>Obiter</i>. It is not what this sort
    of book ought to be, portable and potable, like the craftily
    qualified contents of a pocket-flask, refreshing on a tedious
    journey. Had <i>Obiter</i> been the size of either <i>The Handy
    Volume Shakspeare</i>, or of Messrs. ROUTLEDGE'S
    Redbacks&mdash;both the Baron's prime favourites&mdash;the
    Baron would have been able to dip into it more frequently, as
    he would into that same pocket-flask aforementioned.</p>

    <p>"Next, please!" BLACKIE'S <i>Modern Cyclopedia</i>. Vol.
    VII., so we're getting along. I'll just cast my eye over it;
    one eye, not two, says the Baron, out of compliment to the
    Cyclops. This Volume deals with the letters "P," "R," "S," and
    any person wishing to master a few really interesting subjects
    for dinner conversation will read and learn up all about
    Procyon, Pizemysi, and Pyrheliometer, Quotelet, Quintal, and
    Quito, Regulus, Ramazan, Rheumatism, Rhynchops, Rum-Shrub, and
    Rupar, Samoyedes, Semiquaver, Sahjehanpur, Silket, Sinter, and
    Size. When it is known what a gay conversationalist he is, he
    may induce some one to put him up for a cheery Club, where he
    will be Blackie-balled. Still, by studying the Cyclopedia
    carefully, with a view to being ready with words for charades
    and dumb-crambo during the festive Christmas-tide, he may once
    again achieve a certain amount of popularity, on which, as on
    fresh laurels, he had better retire.</p>

    <p>"Next, please!" <i>How Stanley Wrote his Darkest Africa</i>.
    By Mr. E. MARSTON. A most interesting little book, published by
    SAMPSON LOW &amp; Co., illustrated with excellent photographs,
    and with a couple of light easy sketches, by, I suppose, the
    Author, which makes the Baron regret that he didn't do more of
    them. "Buy it," says the Baron. The Baron recommends the
    perusal of this little book, if only to understand the full
    meaning of the old proverbial expression "Going on a wild-goose
    chase." The author is a wonderfully rapid-act traveller. He
    apparently can "run" round every principal city in Europe and
    see everything that's worth seeing in it in about an hour and a
    half at most. In this manner, and by not comprehending a word
    of the language wherever he is, or at all events only a very
    few of the words, he continues to pick up much curious
    information which probably would be novel to slower coaches
    than himself.</p>

    <p>Interesting account of JOSEF ISRAELS in the <i>Magazine of
    Art</i>; but his portrait makes him look gigantic, which JOSEF
    is in Art, but not in stature. Those who "know not JOSEF," if
    any such there be, will learn much about him, and desire to
    know more. "Baroness," says the Baron, "you are right: let
    Hostesses and all dinner-givers read 'Some Humours of the
    Cuisine' in <i>The Woman's World</i>." The parodies of the
    style of Mr. PATER, and of a translation of a Tolstoian Romance
    in <i>The Cornhill Magazine</i>, are capital. In the same
    number, "Farmhouse Notes" are to The Baron like the Rule of
    Three in the ancient rhyme to the youthful student,&mdash;"it
    puzzles <i>me</i>." It includes a few anecdotes of some
    Farm'ous Persons; so perhaps the title is a
    crypto-punnygraph.</p>

    <p>All Etonians should possess <i>The English Illustrated

    interesting paper on the Beefsteak Room at the Lyceum by
    FREDERICK HAWKINS. Delightful Beefsteak Room! What pleasant
    little suppers&mdash;But no matter&mdash;my supper time is

    to be the warning inscribed over every Club or other

    new tune to replace the "<i>Boulanger March</i>!" If the new

    variations, in which sharps and flats would play a considerable
    part, and, finally, after a chromatic scale, down not up, of
    accidentals, it should finish in the minor <i>rallentando
    diminuendo</i>, and end like the comic overture (whose we

    <h2>NATIVE GROWTH.</h2>

    <p>According to a case about oysters&mdash;instead of a case,
    it ought to have been a barrel&mdash;heard before Mr. Alderman
    WILKIN,&mdash;and as the case may be still
    <i>sub-Aldermanice</i>, we have nothing to say as to its merits
    or demerits,&mdash;it appears, that in September, 1889, the
    price of Royal Whitstable Natives was 14<i>s.</i> per 100;
    <i>i.e.</i>, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> for a baker's dozen of
    thirteen. Though why a baker should be allowed "a little one
    in," be it oysters or anything else, only Heaven and the
    erudite Editor of <i>Notes and Queries</i> know. But, without
    further allusion to the baker, who has just dropped in
    accidentally as he did into the conversation between <i>Mrs.
    Bardell</i> and <i>Mrs. Cluppins</i>, when <i>Sam Weller</i>
    joined in, and they all "got a talking," it is enough to make
    any oyster-lover's mouth water&mdash;no doubt the worthy
    Alderman's did water,&mdash;did water "like WILKIN!"&mdash;to
    hear that while everybody, including the worthy Alderman
    aforesaid, was paying 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and 3<i>s.</i>,
    and even 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for real Natives, some people
    were gratifying their molluscous tastes at the small charge of
    One Shilling and Threepence for thirteen, or were getting six
    oysters and a half&mdash;the half be demm'd&mdash;for sixpence.
    Long time is it since we paid 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> for Real
    Royal Natives. They may have left Whitstable at that price, but
    they never came to our Wits' Table at anything like that
    figure. Still, to the truly Christian mind it is pleasant, if
    not consoling, to know that some of our fellow-creatures, not
    generally so well-favoured as ourselves, should have been able
    to take advantage of the most favoured Native clause in the
    Oyster Season of 1889.</p>

    <h2>LOOKING FORWARD.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Extract from "The Daily Prize-fighter," September 24,
    1900.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Yesterday morning LOO BOBBETT and BEN MOUSETRAP had an
    interview with Mr. PHEASANT, the Magistrate presiding in the
    North-West London Police Court. The approaches to the Court
    were crowded from an early hour. Amongst those in the street we
    noticed BILLY BLOWFROTH, and SAM SNEEZER, the well-known
    pot-boys from "The Glove and Wadding" and "The Tap o'Claret"
    Hotels, SHINY MOSES, AARON ISAACS, and SANDY the Sossidge
    (so-called by his friends on account of his appearance), the
    celebrated bankers from the West-end of Whitechapel, and a
    large gathering of the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the Lambeth Road.
    Inside the Court the company was, if possible, even more
    select. Mr. TITAN CHAPEL, the proprietor of the Featherbed
    Club, was the first to arrive in his private brougham, and he
    was followed at short intervals by the Earl of ARRIEMORE, Lord
    TRIMI GLOVESON, Mr. TOOWITH YEW, Mr. BRANDIC OHLD, Mr. SPLITTS
    ODER, Mr. GINCOCK TALE, and Mr. ANGUS TEWBER, with a heap more
    of the best known patrons of sport in the Metropolis. Little
    time was cut to waste in the preliminaries, and it was
    generally acknowledged at the end of the day that no prettier
    set-to had been witnessed for a long time than that which took
    place at the North-West London Police Court. We append below
    some of the more salient portions of the evidence.</p>

    <p><i>Inspector Chizzlem</i>. I produce a pair of gloves
    ordinarily used at London boxing matches. [<i>Produces them
    from his waistcoat pocket.</i></p>

    <p><i>Mr. Pheasant</i> (<i>the Magistrate</i>). Pardon me. I
    don't quite understand. Were the gloves that you produce to be
    used at this particular competition?</p>

    <p><i>Inspector Chizzlem</i>. No, your Worship. These are one
    ounce gloves. The gloves with which these men were to fight are
    known as "feather-weight" gloves.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Pheasant</i>. Ah, I see. Feather-weight, not
    feather-bed, I presume. (<i>Loud Laughter, in which both the
    accused joined.</i>) Have you the actual gloves with you?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Titan Chapel</i> (<i>from the Solicitor's table</i>).
    I have brought them, Sir. Here&mdash;dear me, what can I have
    done with them? I thought I had them somewhere about me.
    (<i>Pats his various pockets. A thought strikes him. He pulls
    out his watch</i>.) Ah, of course, how foolish of me! I
    generally carry them in my watch-case.</p>

    <blockquote>
        [<i>Opens watch, produces them, and hands them up to
        Magistrate</i>.
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mr. Pheasant</i>. Dear me!&mdash;so these are gloves. I
    know I am inexperienced in these matters, but they look to me
    rather like elastic bands. (<i>Roars of laughter. Mr. PHEASANT
    tries them on.</i>) However, they teem to fit very nicely. Yes,
    who is the next witness?</p>

    <p><i>The Earl of Arriemore</i> (<i>entering the
    witness-box</i>). I am, my noble sportsman.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Pheasant</i>. Who are you?</p>

    <p><i>The Earl of Arriemore</i>. ARRIEMORE'S my name, yer
    Washup, wich I'm a bloomin' Lord.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Pheasant</i>. Of course&mdash;of course. Now tell me,
    have you ever boxed at all yourself?</p>

    <p><i>The Earl of Arriemore</i>. Never, thwulp me, never! But I
    like to set the lads on to do a bit of millin' for me.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Pheasant</i>. Quite so. Very right and proper. What
    do you say to the gloves produced by the inspector?</p>

    <p><i>The Earl of Arriemore</i>. Call <i>them</i> gloves? Why,
    I calls 'em woolsacks, that's what I calls 'em. [<i>Much
    laughter.</i></p>

    <p><i>Mr. Pheasant</i>. No doubt, that would be so. But now
    with regard to these other gloves, do you say they would be
    calculated to deaden the force of a blow; in fact, to prevent
    such a contest from degenerating into a merely brutal
    exhibition, and to make it, as I understand it ought to be, a
    contest of pure skill?</p>

    <p><i>The Earl of Arriemore</i>. That's just it. Why, two
    babbies might box with them gloves and do themselves no harm.
    And, as to skill, why it wants a lot of skill to hit with 'em
    at all.</p>

    <blockquote>
        [<i>Winks at Lord TRIMI GLOVESON, who winks back.</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mr. Pheasant</i>. Really? That is very interesting, very
    interesting indeed! I think perhaps the best plan will be for
    the two principals to accompany me into my private room, to
    give a practical exemplification of the manner in which such a
    contest is generally conducted. (<i>At this point the learned
    Magistrate retired from the Bench, and was followed into his
    private room by LOO BOBBETT. BEN MOUSETRAP, and their Seconds.
    After an hour's interval, Mr. PHEASANT returned to the Bench
    alone</i>.) I will give my decision at once. The prize must be
    handed over to Mr. MOUSETRAP. That last cross-counter of his
    fairly settled Mr. BOBBETT. I held the watch myself, and I know
    that he lay on the ground stunned for a full minute. (<i>To
    the</i> Usher.) Send the Divisional Surgeon into my room at
    once, and fetch an ambulance. The Court will now adjourn.</p>

    <blockquote>
        [<i>Loud applause, which was instantly suppressed.</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mr. Pheasant</i> (<i>sternly</i>). This Court is not a
    Prize-Ring.</p>

    <h2>"A STRUGGLE FOR LIFE" AT THE AVENUE.</h2>

             </a>Alexander the Less and the preux Chevalier.
    </div>

    <p>First of all, the title of the piece is against it. <i>The
    Struggle for Life</i> suggests to the general British Public,
    unacquainted with the name of DAUDET, a melodrama of the type
    of <i>Drink</i>, in which a variety of characters should be
    engaged in the great struggle for existence. It is suggestive
    of strikes, the great struggle between Labour and Capital,
    between class and class, between principal and interest,
    between those with moral principles and those without them. It
    is suggestive of the very climax of melodramatic sensation,
    and, being suggestive of all this to the majority, the majority
    will be disappointed when it doesn't get all that this very
    responsible title has led them to expect. Those who know the
    French novel will be dissatisfied with the English adaptation
    of it, filtered, as it has been, through a French dramatic
    version of the story. So much for the title. For the play
    itself, as given by Messrs. BUCHANAN and HORNER,&mdash;the
    latter of whom, true to ancestral tradition, will have his
    finger in the pie,&mdash;it is but an ordinary drama, strongly
    reminding a public which knows its DICKENS of the story of
    <i>Little Em'ly</i>, with <i>Vaillant</i> for <i>Old
    Peggotty</i>, <i>Lydie</i> for <i>Little Em'ly</i>, <i>Antonin
    Caussade</i> for <i>Ham</i>, and <i>Paul Astier</i> for
    <i>Steerforth</i>. Perhaps it would be carrying the resemblance
    too far to see in <i>Rosa Dartle</i>, with her scorn For "that
    sort of creature," the germ of <i>Esther de
    S&eacute;l&eacute;ny</i>. Mix this with a situation from <i>Le
    Monde o&ugrave; l'on s'ennuie</i>, spoilt in the mixing, and
    there's the drama.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:15%;">
        <a href="images/168-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/168-2.png"
             alt="" /></a>The Avenger.
    </div>

    <p>For the acting&mdash;it is admirable. Miss GENEVIEVE WARD is
    superb as <i>Madame Paul Astier</i>, and it is not her fault,
    but the misfortune of the part, that the wife of <i>Paul</i> is
    a woman old enough to be his mother, with whose
    sufferings&mdash;with her eyes wide open, having married a man
    of whose worthlessness she was aware,&mdash;it is impossible to
    feel very much sympathy. She is old enough to have known
    better. Mr. GEORGE ALEXANDER'S performance of the scoundrel
    <i>Paul</i> leaves little to be desired, but he must struggle
    for dear life against his&mdash;of course,
    unconscious&mdash;imitation of HENRY IRVING. Shut your eyes to
    the facts, occasionally, especially in the death-scene, and it
    is the voice of IRVING; open them, and it is ALEXANDER
    agonising. No one can care for the fine lady, statuesquely
    impersonated by Miss ALMA STANLEY, who yields as easily to
    <i>Paul's</i> seductive wooing as does <i>Lady Anne</i> to
    <i>Richard the Third</i>. After Miss WARD and Mr. ALEXANDER,
    the best performance is that of Miss GRAVES as <i>Little Em'ly
    Lydie</i>, and of Mr. FREDERICK KERR as <i>Antonin Ham
    Caussade</i>,&mdash;the last-named enlisting the genuine
    sympathy of the audience for a character which, in less able
    hands, might have bordered on the grotesque. The comic parts
    have simply been made bores by the adapters, and are not suited
    to the farcical couple, Miss KATE PHILLIPS and Mr. ALBERT
    CHEVALIER, who are cast for them. If this play is to struggle
    successfully for life, the weakest, that is, the comic element,
    should at once go to the wall, and the fittest alone, that is,
    the tragic, should survive. Also, as the play begins at the
    convenient hour of 8.45, it should end punctually at eleven.
    The only realistic scene is in <i>Paul Astier's</i> room, when
    he is dressing for dinner, and washes his hands with real soap,
    uses real towels, and puts real studs and links into his shirt,
    and then suddenly reminded, as it were, by a titter which
    pervades the house, that there are "ladies present," he
    disappears for a few seconds, and returns in his evening-dress
    trowsers and nice clean shirt, looking, except for the absence
    of braces, like a certain well-known haberdasher's pictorial
    advertisement. It is vastly to the credit of the management
    that all the articles of <i>Paul's</i> toilet, including
    Soap(!!), are not turned to pecuniary advantage in the
    advertisements on the programmes. But isn't it a chance lost in
    <i>The Struggle for Life</i> at the Avenue?</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>CITY VESTRIES AND CITY BENEFACTIONS.</h2>

    <p>I have lately had the distinguished honour conferred upon me
    of being unanimously elected a Vestryman of the important
    Parish of Saint Michael-Shear-the-Hog, which I need hardly say
    is situate in the ancient and renowned City of London. I owe my
    election I believe, to the undoubted fact that I am what is
    called&mdash;I scarcely know why&mdash;a tooth-and-nail
    Conservative, no one of anything approaching to Radicalism
    being ever allowed to enter within the sacred precincts of our
    very select Body. Our number is small, but, I am informed, we
    represent the very pick of the Parish, and we have confided to
    us the somewhat desperate task of defending the funds entrusted
    to us, centuries ago, from the fierce attack of Commissioners
    with almost unlimited powers, but with little or no sympathy
    with the sacred wishes of deceased Parishioners.</p>

    <p>Our contention is that wherever, from circumstances that our
    pious ancestors could not have foreseen, it has become simply
    impossible to carry out literally their instructions, the funds
    should be applied to strictly analogous purposes. For instance,
    now in a neighbouring Parish, I am not quite sure whether it is
    St. Margaret Moses, or St. Peter the Queer, a considerable sum
    was bequeathed by a pious parishioner in the reign of Queen
    MARY, of blessed memory, the income from which was to be
    applied to the purchasing of faggots for the burning of
    heretics, which it was probably considered would be a
    considerable saving to the funds of the Parish in question. At
    the present time, as we all know, although there are doubtless
    plenty of heretics, it has ceased to be the custom to burn
    them, so the bequest cannot be applied in accordance with the
    wishes of the pious founder. The important question therefore
    arises, how should the bequest be applied? Would it be believed
    that men are to be found, and men having authority, more's the
    pity, who can recommend its application to the education of the
    poor, to the providing of convalescent hospitals, or even the
    preservation of open spaces for the healthful enjoyment of the
    masses of the Metropolis! Yet such is the sad fact. My Vestry,
    I am proud to say, are unanimously of opinion that, in such a
    case as I have described, common sense and common justice would
    dictate that, as the intentions of the pious founder cannot be
    applied to the punishment of vice, it should be devoted to the
    reward of virtue, and this would be best accomplished by
    expending the fund in question in an annual banquet to those
    Vestrymen who attended the most assiduously to the arduous
    duties of their important office. JOSEPH GREENHORN.</p>

copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
